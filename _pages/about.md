I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Offutt School of Business](https://www.concordiacollege.edu/academics/programs-of-study/offutt-school-of-business/) at [Concordia College](https://www.concordiacollege.edu/).

My [research](research) explores how environmental and institutional shocks influence household decisions and community resilience. I work at the intersection of demographic and environmental economics, with ongoing projects on climate variability, migration, fertility, and education policy.

In the classroom, I emphasize applied, inclusive, and data-driven learning. My [teaching](teaching) experience includes principles of economics, intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics, business data analysis, and management information systems, and I am developing new courses in econometrics, environmental economics, and industrial organization.
