I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/). As an applied microeconomist, my research interests lie in the intersection of Demographic Economics and Environmental Economics where I explore the impact of climatic variations on individual and household level decisions.

 The topics of my [research](research) include the impact of destination and origin specific weather conditions on the migratory decisions of agricultural workers' households, the impact of minimum temperature variations on fertility, and the interactions between perceived air quality and household consumption patterns, and the effect of border enforcement policies on local labor markets.

My [teaching](teaching) experience span courses from introductory macroeconomics, intermediate microeconomics, to a graduate sequence in financial economics. I am actively seeking to expand my teaching portfolio to encompass courses such as environmental economics, labor economics, and applied econometrics.
