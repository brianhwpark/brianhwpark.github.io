I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Offutt School of Business](https://www.concordiacollege.edu/academics/programs-of-study/offutt-school-of-business/) at [Concordia College](https://www.concordiacollege.edu/). As an applied microeconomist, my research interests lie at the intersection of demographic and environmental economics, with a focus on how climatic variations influence household decisions such as migration and fertility.

The topics of my [research](research) include the effects of destination-origin-specific weather conditions on the migration decisions of agricultural households, the impact of minimum temperature fluctuations on fertility, the relationship between perceived air quality and household consumption patterns, and the influence of border enforcement policies on local labor markets.

My primary [teaching](teaching) experience includes intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics, as well as courses ranging from introductory business data analysis to a graduate sequence in financial economics. I am actively working to expand my teaching portfolio to include courses such as environmental economics, labor economics, and applied econometrics.
