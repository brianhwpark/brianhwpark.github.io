I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the Department of Business and Economics at [Monmouth College](https://www.monmouthcollege.edu/). As an applied microeconomist, my research interests lie in the intersection of Demographic Economics and Environmental Economics, more specifically in the analysis of the effect of climatic variations on various facets of household choices, such as migration and fertility.

The topics of my [research](research) include the impact of destination-origin specific weather conditions on the migratory decisions of agricultural workers' households, , the effect of minimum temperature variations on fertility, the interactions between perceived air quality and household consumption patterns, and the influence of border enforcement policies on local labor markets.

My [teaching](teaching) experience spans courses from introductory macroeconomics and intermediate microeconomics to a graduate sequence in financial economics. I am actively seeking to expand my teaching portfolio to encompass courses such as environmental economics, labor economics, and applied econometrics.
